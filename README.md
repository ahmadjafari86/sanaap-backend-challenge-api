## Local setup

Requirements:
- Docker Engine with Docker Compose v2 supporting `--wait`
- GNU Make
- Internet access for the initial build

Start the project:

```bash
make up
```

The command creates `.env` if missing, generates a Django secret key,
builds the images, starts the services, applies database migrations,
and initializes the MinIO buckets.

Services:
- Backend: http://127.0.0.1:8000
- MinIO console: http://127.0.0.1:19001

MinIO console credentials are configured in `.env` through
`MINIO_ROOT_USER` and `MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD`.

Useful commands:

```bash
make ps
make check
make logs
make shell
make down
```

`make down` preserves database and object-storage volumes.

MinIO is built from the official source tag
`RELEASE.2025-09-07T16-13-09Z`.

VPN software that blocks local networks may prevent access to Docker
services. Check local-network access settings if connections fail.

## Development workflow

Feature branches start from `develop` and return through pull requests.
Release branches prepare delivery to `main` and are merged back into
`develop`. Released versions are tagged.
